# Challenge Amigo Secreto

## Description 

Secret friend
In this challenge, I developed an application that allows users to enter names of friends
into a list and then conduct a random drawing to determine who the "Secret Friend" is.

The user must add names using a text field and an "Add" button. The names entered will be displayed
in a visible list on the page, and at the end, a "Raffle Friend" button will select one of the names randomly, 
displaying the result on the screen.


## Features

- Add Names: Users will type a friend's name into a text field and add it to a visible list by clicking "Add."
  
- Validate input: If the text field is empty, the program will show an alert asking for a valid name.

- View list: The names entered will appear in a list below the input field.

- Random Draw: By clicking the "Friend Draw" button, a name will be randomly selected from the list and displayed on the page.
