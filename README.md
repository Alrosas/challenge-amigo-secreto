## Description 

Secret friend
In this challenge, I developed an application that allows users to enter names of friends
into a list and then conduct a random drawing to determine who the "Secret Friend" is.

The user must add names using a text field and an "Add" button. The names entered will be displayed
in a visible list on the page, and at the end, a "Raffle Friend" button will select one of the names randomly, 
displaying the result on the screen.
